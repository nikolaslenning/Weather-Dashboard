Weather Dashboard is a repository where I've created a simple weather forecast application that allows the user to input a certain city and displays the current and five day forecast on the page. The forecast information was pulled from a third-party API, OpenWeather, and used to dynamically update the page.

[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org//) was used to pull information about the weather forecast. 

A live link to my [Weather Dashboard](https://nikolaslenning.github.io/weather-dashboard/) is hosted on Github pages.

This application was authored by [Nikolas Lenning](https://github.com/nikolaslenning).
